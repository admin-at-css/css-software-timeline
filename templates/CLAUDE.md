# Instructions for Claude Code

When asked to create a `timeline.yaml` file for this project, follow these steps:

## 1. Choose the Right Template

- **Use `timeline-minimal.yaml`** if the project is:
  - An idea or concept
  - In planning phase
  - Early stage with unclear scope

- **Use `timeline-full.yaml`** if the project is:
  - In active development
  - Has clear phases or milestones
  - Needs detailed hour tracking

## 2. Gather Project Information

Before creating the file, ask the user for:

1. **Project basics:**
   - Project name (human-readable)
   - Brief description (what problem does it solve?)
   - Current status: `draft` | `planning` | `in_progress` | `on_hold` | `completed`
   - Priority: `critical` | `high` | `medium` | `low`
   - Why this priority? (for stakeholders)

2. **Timeline:**
   - Start date (when work began or will begin)
   - End date (target completion, if known)

3. **Hours:**
   - Estimated total hours for the project
   - Actual hours spent so far

4. **Tasks/Phases:**
   - What are the major chunks of work?
   - For each task: name, start date, end date, estimated hours, status, progress %
   - Any milestones? (key checkpoints)

5. **Repository:**
   - GitHub URL
   - Which branch? (usually `main`)

## 3. Create timeline.yaml

1. Copy the appropriate template to the project root as `timeline.yaml`
2. Replace all placeholder values with actual project data
3. Generate a unique `id` (lowercase, dashes, e.g., `css-chrome-extension`)
4. Set `metadata.lastUpdated` to current ISO timestamp
5. Ensure all dates use `YYYY-MM-DD` format

## 4. Validate the File

Check that:
- [ ] All required fields are present (see template comments)
- [ ] Dates are in YYYY-MM-DD format
- [ ] Status values are valid enums
- [ ] At least one stakeholder exists
- [ ] At least one task exists
- [ ] Task dependencies reference existing task IDs
- [ ] Progress values are 0-100

## 5. Commit

```bash
git add timeline.yaml
git commit -m "Add timeline.yaml for CSS Software Timeline dashboard"
git push
```

## Example Prompt for User

If the user just says "create timeline.yaml", ask:

> To create your timeline.yaml, I need some information:
> 1. What's the current status of this project? (planning/in_progress/etc.)
> 2. When did you start, and when do you expect to finish?
> 3. How many hours do you estimate for the whole project?
> 4. How many hours have you already spent?
> 5. What are the main phases or tasks? For each, what's the status and progress?
> 6. What's the priority level, and why?
