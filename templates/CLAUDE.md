# Instructions for Claude Code: Creating timeline.yaml

When asked to create a `timeline.yaml` file for this project, **DO NOT immediately ask the user questions**. You have access to the entire codebase - use it!

## Step 1: Explore the Codebase First

Before asking anything, gather information from:

1. **README.md** - Project name, description, purpose
2. **package.json / Cargo.toml / etc.** - Project metadata, dependencies, scripts
3. **Git history** - Run these commands:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline --reverse | head -1   # First commit = approximate start date
   git log --oneline | head -10            # Recent activity
   git log --format="%ad" --date=short | sort | uniq | wc -l  # Days with commits
   ```
4. **Source code structure** - Identify major features/modules
5. **Existing documentation** - Any specs, design docs, or notes

## Step 2: Infer What You Can

From your exploration, determine:

| Field | How to Infer |
|-------|--------------|
| `id` | Repository/folder name, lowercase with dashes |
| `name` | From README title or package.json name |
| `description` | From README or package.json description |
| `status` | From code completeness: has tests? deployed? README says "WIP"? |
| `startDate` | First git commit date |
| `repository.url` | From `git remote -v` |
| `tasks` | From code structure: setup, core features, UI, tests, etc. |

**Estimate hours based on codebase size:**
- Small project (<1000 LOC): 20-40 hours
- Medium project (1000-5000 LOC): 40-100 hours
- Large project (5000+ LOC): 100+ hours

**Estimate task progress based on:**
- Feature has tests = likely complete
- Feature has TODO comments = in progress
- Feature folder exists but empty/minimal = pending

## Step 3: Only Ask What You Cannot Determine

After exploring, you should ONLY need to ask:

1. **Priority level** - `critical` | `high` | `medium` | `low`
2. **Priority reason** - Why this priority? (for stakeholders)
3. **Target end date** - When should this ship? (if not already deployed)
4. **Actual hours spent** - Only the user knows this
5. **Corrections** - "I found X, Y, Z - is this accurate?"

**Example prompt after exploration:**

> I've analyzed the codebase and here's what I found:
>
> - **Project**: CSS Chrome Extension
> - **Description**: Browser extension for CSS team productivity
> - **Started**: November 15, 2024 (first commit)
> - **Status**: In progress (~70% complete based on code)
> - **Estimated hours**: ~80 hours (based on codebase size)
>
> **Tasks I identified:**
> 1. Extension Setup (completed - manifest.json exists, basic structure done)
> 2. Core Features (in progress - popup and content scripts partially implemented)
> 3. Polish & Testing (pending - no tests yet)
>
> **I need from you:**
> 1. What's the priority level? (critical/high/medium/low)
> 2. Why this priority? (one sentence for stakeholders)
> 3. Target completion date?
> 4. How many actual hours have you spent so far?

## Step 4: Create timeline.yaml

Choose the appropriate template:
- **`timeline-minimal.yaml`** - For idea/planning phase projects
- **`timeline-full.yaml`** - For active development with clear phases

Create `timeline.yaml` in the project root with:
- All inferred values filled in
- User-provided values for priority, hours, dates
- `metadata.lastUpdated` set to current ISO timestamp

## Step 5: Validate

Check that:
- [ ] All required fields present
- [ ] Dates in YYYY-MM-DD format
- [ ] Valid status/priority enum values
- [ ] At least one stakeholder (default: Kevin Zakaria, Developer)
- [ ] At least one task with valid dependencies
- [ ] Progress values 0-100

## Step 6: Clean Up Templates Folder

**IMPORTANT:** The `templates/` folder is a temporary tool - do NOT commit it to the project repo.

After creating `timeline.yaml`, clean up:

```bash
# Option A: Delete the templates folder (recommended)
rm -rf templates/

# Option B: Add to .gitignore if you want to keep it locally
echo "templates/" >> .gitignore
```

## Step 7: Commit Only timeline.yaml

```bash
git add timeline.yaml
git commit -m "Add timeline.yaml for CSS Software Timeline dashboard"
git push
```

**What gets committed:**
- `timeline.yaml` - YES, this is the project's timeline data

**What should NOT be committed:**
- `templates/` folder - NO, this is just a reference tool
- `templates/CLAUDE.md` - NO, instructions are only needed during creation

## Quick Reference

### Project Status
| Status | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|
| `draft` | Just an idea, no code yet |
| `planning` | Designing, no implementation |
| `in_progress` | Active development |
| `on_hold` | Paused |
| `completed` | Shipped/Done |
| `cancelled` | Abandoned |

### Task Status
| Status | Indicators |
|--------|------------|
| `pending` | Folder/file doesn't exist or is empty |
| `in_progress` | Has code but incomplete, TODOs present |
| `completed` | Feature works, has tests, no TODOs |
| `blocked` | Depends on external factor |

### Priority
| Level | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `critical` | Blocking other work, must ship ASAP |
| `high` | Important, prioritize this |
| `medium` | Normal priority |
| `low` | Nice to have, can wait |

## Key Principle

**You are an intelligent assistant with full codebase access. Act like it.**

Don't ask the user to describe their own code - read it yourself. Only ask for information that genuinely requires human input (priorities, business context, time spent).
